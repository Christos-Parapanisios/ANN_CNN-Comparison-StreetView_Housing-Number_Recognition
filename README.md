## Street View Housing Number Digit Recognition
Context:
- The SVHN dataset, with over 600,000 labeled street-level digit images, is crucial for object recognition tasks, like improving map accuracy by transcribing address numbers.

Objective:
- Predict digits in images using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) or Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and identify the best model.

Dataset:
- A preprocessed subset of the SVHN dataset is provided in a .h5 file to save computation time.
